# Fluid Droplet Management System

A comprehensive Fluid droplet template that provides complete droplet lifecycle management, order processing, product management, and webhook handling capabilities.

## 🚀 What This Droplet Does

This is a full-featured Fluid droplet that provides:

- **Complete Droplet Management** - Create, update, and manage Fluid droplets
- **Order Processing System** - Handle orders with status tracking and management
- **Product Management** - Full CRUD operations for products with inventory tracking
- **Webhook Integration** - Secure webhook handling for real-time data synchronization
- **Company Management** - Multi-tenant support with company-specific data isolation
- **DIT Token Authentication** - Automatic company authentication using Fluid DIT tokens
- **Dashboard Interface** - Modern React frontend with comprehensive management tools

## 🔑 Authentication System

This droplet uses **DIT (Droplet Installation Token)** authentication, which means:

- **No Manual API Keys Required** - Companies don't need to provide their own API keys
- **Automatic Authentication** - When a company installs your droplet, Fluid automatically provides a DIT token
- **Secure by Default** - DIT tokens are scoped to the specific installation and company
- **Zero Configuration** - Companies can start using your droplet immediately after installation

### How DIT Tokens Work

1. **Company installs your droplet** → Fluid generates a unique DIT token
2. **DIT token is sent via webhook** → Your backend receives and stores it
3. **API calls use DIT token** → All Fluid API calls are authenticated automatically
4. **No manual setup required** → Companies don't need to configure anything

## Project Structure

- `frontend/` - Simple React app that shows company info
- `backend/` - Node.js API with webhook handling
- `database/` - PostgreSQL with Prisma for company data
- `scripts/` - Tools to create and update your droplet

## Quick Start

### 🐳 Docker Development (Recommended)

1. **Start with Docker:**
```bash
# Copy environment template
cp env.dev.example .env.dev
# Edit .env.dev with your Fluid credentials

# Start development environment
./scripts/dev-start.sh
# OR
npm run docker:dev
```

**Access Points:**
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend: http://localhost:3001
- Database Admin: http://localhost:8080

### 📦 Traditional Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
cd frontend && npm install
cd ../backend && npm install
```

2. **Set up database:**
```bash
npm run prisma:push
```

3. **Start development:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Deployment Options

### 🌐 Google Cloud Platform (Recommended)

**Quick Deploy to GCP:**
```bash
# 1. Set up secrets and database
./gcp/setup-secrets.sh
./gcp/setup-database.sh

# 2. Deploy to Cloud Run
./gcp/deploy.sh
```

See [`GCP-DEPLOYMENT.md`](GCP-DEPLOYMENT.md) for complete guide.

### 🚀 Other Platforms

1. **Deploy to production** (Render, Vercel, etc.)
2. **Get your Fluid API key** from your Fluid account
3. **Create the droplet:**
```bash
FLUID_API_KEY=your_api_key_here \
EMBED_URL=https://your-frontend-url.com/ \
DROPLET_NAME="My Simple Droplet" \
node scripts/create-droplet.js
```

## How It Works

1. **Company installs droplet** → Fluid sends webhook to your backend
2. **Backend stores company info** (name, logo) in database
3. **Frontend loads** → shows company name and logo in clean header
4. **That's it!** Simple and clean.

---

## Step 2: Get Your Own Copy of the Template

You need to make your own copy of the Fluid droplet template. Here are two ways to do it:

### Option A: Clone with Git (Recommended for Cursor)

This is the best way if you plan to use Cursor IDE for development:

1. **Copy the repository URL:** `https://github.com/fluid-commerce/Droplet-Template-React-.git`
2. **Open your terminal/command prompt**
3. **Navigate to where you want the project:** 
   ```bash
   cd Desktop  # or wherever you want it
   ```
4. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fluid-commerce/Droplet-Template-React-.git
   ```
5. **Enter the project folder:**
   ```bash
   cd Droplet-Template-React-
   ```

### Option B: Download as ZIP

If you prefer to download directly:

1. **Go to the [template repository](https://github.com/fluid-commerce/Droplet-Template-React-)** on GitHub
2. **Click the green "Code" button**
3. **Click "Download ZIP"**
4. **Extract the ZIP file** to your Desktop or preferred location
5. **The folder will be named** `Droplet-Template-React-` (you can rename it if you prefer)

## Step 2.5: Open in Cursor IDE

Now let's get your template into Cursor for that sweet AI-powered development experience:

### Install Cursor (if you haven't already):

1. **Go to [cursor.sh](https://cursor.sh)**
2. **Download Cursor** for your operating system
3. **Install it** like any other app

### Open Your Project in Cursor:

**Method 1 - From Cursor:**
1. **Open Cursor IDE**
2. **Click "Open Folder"** or use `Cmd+O` (Mac) / `Ctrl+O` (Windows)
3. **Navigate to your `Droplet-Template-React-` folder**
4. **Click "Open"**

**Method 2 - From Terminal (if you cloned):**
1. **Make sure you're in the project folder:**
   ```bash
   cd Droplet-Template-React-
   ```
2. **Open in Cursor:**
   ```bash
   cursor .
   ```

**Method 3 - Drag and Drop:**
1. **Open Cursor IDE**
2. **Drag your `Droplet-Template-React-` folder** directly into the Cursor window

### What You'll See in Cursor:

Once opened, you'll see the complete project structure:
- `frontend/` - React app with TypeScript
- `backend/` - Node.js API server  
- `database/` - PostgreSQL migrations
- `scripts/` - Automation helpers

**🎉 You're now ready to start vibing with AI-powered development!**

Cursor will understand your entire codebase and can help you:
- Add new integrations (just ask: "Add Shopify integration")
- Customize the UI ("Make the dashboard more modern")
- Debug issues ("Why is my webhook not working?")
- Add features ("Add bulk data import functionality")

## Step 2.6: Create Your Own GitHub Repository

Since you cloned the template, you need to create your own repository to save your customizations:

### Create a New Repository on GitHub:

1. **Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and sign in**
2. **Click the "+" icon** in the top right corner
3. **Click "New repository"**
4. **Name your repository** (e.g., `my-fluid-droplet` or `shopify-email-sync`)
5. **Make it Public** (required for free Render deployment)
6. **Don't initialize** with README, .gitignore, or license (you already have these)
7. **Click "Create repository"**

### Connect Your Local Code to Your New Repository:

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Follow these steps:

1. **In your terminal/command prompt, make sure you're in your project folder:**
   ```bash
   cd Droplet-Template-React-
   ```

2. **Remove the connection to the original template:**
   ```bash
   git remote remove origin
   ```

3. **Connect to your new repository** (replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPO_NAME`):
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
   ```

4. **Push your code to your repository:**
   ```bash
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### After Making Changes in Cursor:

Whenever you customize your droplet in Cursor, you need to save and push your changes:

1. **Save your files** in Cursor (`Cmd+S` or `Ctrl+S`)

2. **In terminal, add your changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

3. **Commit your changes with a message:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add Shopify integration and custom styling"
   ```

4. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git push
   ```

**🚀 Important:** Render automatically deploys when you push to GitHub! Your changes will be live in 2-3 minutes.

---

## Step 3: Create Your Render Account

Render is where your app will live on the internet.

1. **Go to [render.com](https://render.com)**
2. **Click "Get Started for Free"**
3. **Choose "Sign up with GitHub"** - this connects your accounts
4. **Click "Authorize"** when GitHub asks for permission
5. **Fill out your profile:**
   - Pick a username
   - Choose the Free plan (perfect for starting)
   - Verify your email if asked

---

## Step 4: Deploy Your App to Render

This is where the magic happens! Render will automatically create everything you need.

### What is a Blueprint?
A Blueprint is like a recipe that tells Render exactly how to build your app. Your template includes this recipe, so Render knows what to do.

### Understanding the render.yaml File

Your template includes a special file called `render.yaml` that acts as the blueprint. Here's what it does:

**The render.yaml file tells Render to create:**
- **Frontend Service** - Hosts your React app (Static Site)
- **Backend Service** - Runs your Node.js API server (Web Service) 
- **PostgreSQL Database** - Stores all your data securely

**How Environment Variables Work:**
The render.yaml file defines which environment variables your app needs, but it doesn't include the actual secret values (for security). You'll add the real values manually in Render's dashboard.

**Template includes these pre-configured variables:**
- `DATABASE_URL` - Automatically set by Render (connects to your database)
- `FLUID_API_KEY` - You'll add your Fluid API key
- `FLUID_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - You'll add your webhook secret
- `JWT_SECRET` - You'll generate this for security
- `ENCRYPTION_KEY` - You'll generate this to encrypt data
- `NODE_ENV` - Set to "production"
- `PORT` - Set to 3001 for the backend

### Adding New Variables When You Add Features

**When you add integrations (like Shopify, Stripe, etc.), you'll need to:**

1. **Add to render.yaml** - So Render knows your app needs them
2. **Add to Render dashboard** - So your app can access the real values
3. **Use in your code** - So your integration can connect

**Example: Adding Shopify Integration**

If you ask Cursor to "Add Shopify integration," it will help you:

**Step 1: Update render.yaml**
```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: my-droplet-backend
    env: node
    buildCommand: cd backend && npm install && npm run build
    startCommand: cd backend && npm start
    envVars:
      # ... existing variables ...
      - key: SHOPIFY_API_KEY
        sync: false
      - key: SHOPIFY_SECRET_KEY  
        sync: false
      - key: SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET
        sync: false
```

**Step 2: Add Values in Render Dashboard**
- Go to your Backend service → Environment tab
- Add `SHOPIFY_API_KEY` with your actual Shopify API key
- Add `SHOPIFY_SECRET_KEY` with your Shopify secret
- Add `SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` with your webhook secret

**Step 3: Use in Your Code**
Cursor will automatically generate code that uses these variables:
```typescript
const shopifyClient = new ShopifyApi({
  apiKey: process.env.SHOPIFY_API_KEY,
  secretKey: process.env.SHOPIFY_SECRET_KEY,
  webhookSecret: process.env.SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET
});
```

### Deploy Your App:

1. **In Render, click "New +"** (top right corner)
2. **Click "Blueprint"** from the menu
3. **Connect your GitHub:**
   - If not connected, click "Connect GitHub account"
   - Select your repository (the one your droplet lives in)
   - Choose the `main` branch
4. **Review what will be created:**
   - You'll see 3 services: Frontend, Backend, and Database
   - This is normal and exactly what you want
5. **Click "Apply"** to start building

### What Happens Next:
- Render reads your template
- Creates 3 separate services (like 3 different computers working together)
- Builds your app and makes it live on the internet
- Sets up a database to store information
- Gives you web addresses where people can access your app

**This takes 5-10 minutes.** You can grab a coffee while it builds!

---

## Step 5: Create Your Fluid Account

Fluid is where people will find and install your droplet.

1. **Go to [fluid.app](https://fluid.app)**
2. **Click "Sign Up"** or "Get Started"
3. **Enter your email and password**
4. **Check your email** and click the verification link

---

## Step 6: Get Your API Keys

API keys are like passwords that let your app talk to other services.

### Get Your Fluid API Key:

1. **Log into your Fluid account**
2. **Look for "Developer" or "API" section** in the menu
3. **Find "API Key" or "API Keys"**
4. **Create a new API key:**
   - Name it something like "My Droplet Integration"
   - Copy the key (it starts with `PT-`)
   - **⚠️ Save this somewhere safe - you'll need it soon!**

### Create a Webhook Secret:

A webhook secret is like a password that proves messages are really from Fluid.

**Easy way to create one:**
1. **Go to [generate-secret.vercel.app/32](https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32)**
2. **Copy the generated string**
3. **Save it somewhere safe**

---

## Step 7: Set Up Your App Settings

Your app needs to know some secret information to work. These are called "environment variables."

**Remember:** The `render.yaml` file already told Render which variables your app needs, but it didn't include the actual secret values. Now you'll add the real values so your app can use them.

### How to Add Settings in Render:

1. **In your Render dashboard, find your Backend service**
2. **Click on it, then click "Environment" tab**
3. **Add these settings one by one:**

#### Required Settings:

**FLUID_API_KEY**
- Key: `FLUID_API_KEY`
- Value: `PT-your-actual-api-key-here` (the one you copied from Fluid)

**FLUID_WEBHOOK_SECRET**  
- Key: `FLUID_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- Value: `your-32-character-secret-here` (the one you generated)

**JWT_SECRET**
- Key: `JWT_SECRET`
- Value: Go to [generate-secret.vercel.app/64](https://generate-secret.vercel.app/64) and copy the result

**ENCRYPTION_KEY**
- Key: `ENCRYPTION_KEY`
- Value: Go to [generate-secret.vercel.app/32](https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32) and copy the result

**NODE_ENV**
- Key: `NODE_ENV`
- Value: `production`

**PORT**
- Key: `PORT`
- Value: `3001`

### How to Add Each Setting:

1. **Click "Add Environment Variable"**
2. **Type the Key** (like `FLUID_API_KEY`)
3. **Type the Value** (like your actual API key)
4. **Click "Save Changes"**
5. **Repeat for each setting**

---

## Step 8: Get Your App URLs

After your app finishes building, you'll get web addresses where it lives.

### Find Your URLs:

1. **In Render dashboard, look at your services**
2. **Find your Frontend service** - click on it
3. **Copy the URL** (something like `https://your-app-frontend.onrender.com`)
4. **Find your Backend service** - click on it  
5. **Copy the URL** (something like `https://your-app-backend.onrender.com`)

### Add URL Settings:

Go back to your Backend service environment variables and add:

**FRONTEND_URL**
- Key: `FRONTEND_URL`
- Value: Your frontend URL

**WEBHOOK_BASE_URL**
- Key: `WEBHOOK_BASE_URL`  
- Value: Your backend URL

### Add Frontend Settings:

1. **Go to your Frontend service** in Render
2. **Click "Environment" tab**
3. **Add this setting:**

**VITE_API_BASE_URL**
- Key: `VITE_API_BASE_URL`
- Value: Your backend URL

---

## Step 9: Test Your App

Let's make sure everything is working!

### Test Your Backend:

1. **Open a new browser tab**
2. **Go to your backend URL** + `/health`
   - Example: `https://your-backend.onrender.com/health`
3. **You should see:** `{"status":"ok","timestamp":"..."}`

### Test Your Frontend:

1. **Go to your frontend URL**
2. **You should see your droplet interface**
3. **It should load without any error messages**

If something doesn't work, check the logs in Render dashboard.

---

## Step 10: Register Your Droplet with Fluid

Now you need to tell Fluid about your droplet so people can find it.

### Create Your Droplet:

1. **Open a text editor** (like Notepad or TextEdit)
2. **Copy this command** and replace the parts in CAPS:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.fluid.app/api/droplets \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_FLUID_API_KEY_HERE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "droplet": {
      "name": "Your Droplet Name",
      "embed_url": "YOUR_FRONTEND_URL_HERE/",
      "active": true,
      "settings": {
        "marketplace_page": {
          "title": "Your Droplet Name",
          "summary": "Description of what your droplet does",
          "logo_url": "https://your-logo-url.com/logo.png"
        },
        "details_page": {
          "title": "Your Droplet Name", 
          "summary": "Description of what your droplet does",
          "logo_url": "https://your-logo-url.com/logo.png"
        }
      }
    }
  }'
```

3. **Replace these parts:**
   - `YOUR_FLUID_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key
   - `YOUR_FRONTEND_URL_HERE` with your actual frontend URL
   - `Your Droplet Name` with what you want to call your droplet
   - `Description of what your droplet does` with a description

4. **Save the file** as `create-droplet.txt`

### Run the Command:

**If you're on Windows:**
1. **Open Command Prompt** (search for "cmd" in Start menu)
2. **Copy and paste your command**
3. **Press Enter**

**If you're on Mac:**
1. **Open Terminal** (search for "Terminal" in Spotlight)
2. **Copy and paste your command**
3. **Press Enter**

### Get Your Droplet ID:

After running the command, you'll get a response that includes a `uuid`. It looks like:
```json
{
  "droplet": {
    "uuid": "drp_abc123xyz789",
    "name": "Your Droplet Name"
  }
}
```

**Copy that UUID** - you'll need it next!

---

## Step 11: Add Your Droplet ID to Render

1. **Go back to your Backend service** in Render
2. **Click "Environment" tab**
3. **Add this setting:**

**DROPLET_ID**
- Key: `DROPLET_ID`
- Value: The UUID you copied (starts with `drp_`)

4. **Click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"** to restart your app

---

## Step 12: Test Everything Together

Now let's test your complete droplet!

### Test the Full Flow:

1. **Go to your Fluid account**
2. **Look for your droplet** in the marketplace or droplets section
3. **Click "Install" on your droplet**
4. **You should see:**
   - Your droplet loads in a window
   - It recognizes your company automatically
   - Shows a success message
   - Displays your company name

### If Something Doesn't Work:

1. **Check Render logs:**
   - Go to Backend service → Logs tab
   - Look for red error messages

2. **Verify your settings:**
   - Make sure all environment variables are set correctly
   - Check that URLs match your actual deployment

3. **Test your endpoints:**
   - Backend health: `https://your-backend.onrender.com/health`
   - Webhook health: `https://your-backend.onrender.com/api/webhook/health`

---

Your template includes helpful scripts to update your droplet.

**Update Your Description:**
```bash
FLUID_API_KEY=PT-your-api-key-here
DROPLET_ID=drp_your-droplet-uuid
DROPLET_NAME="My Awesome Integration"
DROPLET_DESCRIPTION="🚀 Connect your Shopify store with email marketing - sync customers, orders, and more!"
node scripts/update-droplet.js
```

**Update Your Logo:**
1. **Upload your logo** to any image hosting service (like Imgur)
2. **Get the image URL**
3. **Run this command:**

```bash
FLUID_API_KEY=PT-your-api-key-here
DROPLET_ID=drp_your-droplet-uuid
LOGO_URL=https://your-logo-url.com/logo.png
node scripts/update-droplet.js
```

### Make Your Description Better:

- **Use emojis** to make it more interesting
- **Focus on benefits** - what does it do for the user?
- **Keep it short** but informative
- **Include your target audience**

**Example of a good description:**
"🚀 Automatically sync your Shopify store with email marketing platforms. 📧 Get instant customer data, 📊 track order events, and 🎯 create targeted campaigns. Perfect for growing businesses!"

---

## 🔒 Your App is Secure

Your droplet template includes built-in security features:

- **Data is encrypted** - All sensitive information is protected
- **Companies are isolated** - Each company only sees their own data
- **Webhooks are verified** - Only real messages from Fluid are processed
- **Rate limiting** - Prevents anyone from overwhelming your system
- **Input validation** - All data is checked before processing

You don't need to do anything special - it's all built in!

---

## 🗄️ How Your Database Works

Your app automatically creates and manages a database to store information:

- **Company configurations** - Settings for each company that installs your droplet
- **Activity logs** - Records of everything that happens
- **Webhook events** - Messages from Fluid platform
- **Custom data** - Information from connected services

The database is automatically backed up and scales with your app.

---

## 🔧 Adding New Features & Integrations

Now that your droplet is live, here's how to add new features and third-party integrations:

### The Three-Step Process for Any New Integration:

**Every time you add a new service (Shopify, Stripe, Mailchimp, etc.), follow these steps:**

### Step 1: Ask Cursor to Add the Integration
Simply ask Cursor in natural language:
- "Add Shopify integration with product sync"
- "Add Stripe payment processing" 
- "Add Mailchimp email automation"
- "Add Google Sheets data export"

Cursor will generate all the necessary code and tell you what environment variables you need.

### Step 2: Update Your render.yaml File
When Cursor adds the integration, it may tell you to add new environment variables to `render.yaml`. 

**Example for Shopify:**
```yaml
envVars:
  # ... existing variables ...
  - key: SHOPIFY_API_KEY
    sync: false
  - key: SHOPIFY_SECRET_KEY
    sync: false
  - key: SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET
    sync: false
  - key: SHOPIFY_APP_URL
    sync: false
```

### Step 3: Add the Real Values in Render
1. **Go to your Backend service** in Render dashboard
2. **Click "Environment" tab**
3. **Add each new variable** with the real API keys/secrets
4. **Click "Manual Deploy"** to restart with new variables

### Step 4: Push Your Code
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Shopify integration with product sync"
git push
```

Render will automatically deploy your changes in 2-3 minutes!

### Common Integrations & Their Variables:

**Shopify Integration:**
- `SHOPIFY_API_KEY` - Your Shopify app's API key
